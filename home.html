                    <p> ZOË4U FOUNDATION is a well-organized Christ like group. It was formed on 13th September, 2009 in Accra, Ghana. The first meeting was held in a classroom with thirteen teenagers and one adult.</p>

                    <p>
                    The early meetings of the group were called seminars. Seminars were been held every fortnight with attendance between 30 and 50 members. Annual summit was soon introduced with the maiden one titled “Dinner With Glory”. The maiden summit brought over one hundred and fifty people; both adults and young ones to witness the good things of <a href="https://facebook.com/ZOË4UFOUNDATION" target="_blank">ZOË4U FOUNDATION</a>.

                    Because the group was mainly made up of teenagers, Choreography and drama groups were set up to make the young ones more active and to stick together in the foundation. Excursions to scenic places to educate and give exposure to the members were periodically organized. Early places visited are Kakum National Park and Cape Coast Castle, both in Central Region of Ghana.
